# Python 3 Knowledge Base IN PROGRESS

This knowledge base covers the fundamentals of Python and links to resources for programmers using or learning Python 3.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Python 3, here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Official Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): The official documentation for Python 3.
- [Python 3 Tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/): An interactive tutorial for learning Python 3.
- [Python 3 for Beginners](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/): A beginner's guide to Python 3.

## Web Development

Python 3 is a popular choice for web development, and there are many web frameworks available for building web applications. Some of the most popular web frameworks include:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): A full-stack web framework for building complex applications.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/): A micro web framework for building small applications.
- [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/): A flexible web framework for building large applications.
- [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/): A scalable web framework for building high-performance applications.
- [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/): A fast and simple web framework for building small applications.

## Data Science

Python 3 is widely used for data science, and there are many libraries available for working with data. Some of the most commonly used data science libraries include:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): A library for working with arrays and numerical operations.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A library for working with data frames and tables.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A library for creating data visualizations.
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/): A library for scientific computing.

## Machine Learning

Python 3 is also widely used for machine learning, and there are many libraries and frameworks available for this purpose. Some of the most popular machine learning libraries and frameworks include:

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A library for machine learning.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): An open source machine learning framework developed by Google.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): A machine learning library developed by Facebook.
- [Keras](https://keras.io/): A high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK.
- [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/): A library for fast numerical computation that can be run on both CPUs and GPUs.
